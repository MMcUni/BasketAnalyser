# BasketAnalyzer

## Project Description
BasketAnalyzer is a Scala application designed to analyze basic food basket prices. It processes data from a comma-separated text file containing average monthly prices over two years for various basic food items. The application offers functionalities like viewing current prices, identifying price trends, and comparing the average values of different food items.

## To-Do List
- [x] Set up the Scala project environment.
- [x] Read and parse data from `data.txt` into a `Map[String, List[Int]]`.
- [x] Implement function to get the current (most recent) price for each food item.
- [x] Implement function to find the highest and lowest prices for each food item.
- [x] Develop functionality to calculate the median price for each food item.
- [x] Create a method to identify the food item with the largest price rise over the last 6 months.
- [x] Implement functionality for comparing the average values over 2 years of two selected food items.
- [ ] Develop a feature to calculate the total value of a user-inputted food basket based on current prices.
- [x] Design and implement a user-friendly text-based interface with a menu.
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests for each analysis function.
- [ ] Document the application, including test plans and results.
- [ ] Write an evaluation report (800-1000 words) discussing the solution in terms of functional thinking, programming style, and comparison of functional and imperative styles.
- [ ] Finalize and clean up the code for submission.
